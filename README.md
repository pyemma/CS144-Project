# CS144-Project
This is the project for UCLA CS144 Project

In this project, we build a Web service and a Web site that allow users to search and navigate eBay bidding data. Our system manages all of its data at the back-end in the MySQL database and supports browsing and searching interfaces over the Internet. These functionalities are provided by integrating MySQL, Apache Tomcat, Lucene and Axis2 packages.

* Design good relational schema and write Java code to transform the large amount of XML data into MySQL's load file format.
* Build a SOAP-based web service using Apache Tomcat and Apache Axis2. Besides traditional numerical attributes and textual attributes search, our web service also support keyword search by using Apache Lucene.
* Build the web site integrated with Google Map and Google suggestion, using Java servlet and AJAX.
* Secure the web site by enabling https and session managemant.
